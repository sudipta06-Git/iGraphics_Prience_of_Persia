 *
 * FIX: landing used to charge `playerHealth -= gravitalForce / 5` for
 * EVERY landing, no matter how short the drop was. Three things came
 * out of that, all of which felt like the life bar leaking:
 *
 *   1. THE GAME START. The player is placed at playerY = 300, but the
 *      floor under him at x = 300 in Level 1 is at 220 - so he falls
 *      80px (16 ticks) and is charged 3 health before the player has
 *      pressed a single key.
 *   2. STEPPING DOWN OFF ANY BRICK. Every ordinary step from one
 *      platform onto a slightly lower one was charged too, so simply
 *      walking through a level slowly ate the bar.
 *   3. THE DROP AFTER A RESPAWN, on top of the half-health penalty the
 *      respawn had just applied (that one was already handled by
 *      skipFallDamage, which is now also set at the start of a level).
 *
 * Now the first FALL_DAMAGE_FREE_TICKS of a fall cost nothing and only
 * the part beyond that is charged. 24 ticks is about 120px, which is
 * more than the height difference between any two neighbouring
 * platforms anywhere in Levels 1, 2 and 3 - so normal platforming never
 * costs health at all, while a genuine long drop (such as the 300px
 * fall off Level 1's high block) still hurts, as it should.
 *
 * To switch fall damage off completely, set this to a large number
