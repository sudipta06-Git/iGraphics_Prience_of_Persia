// True floor edges for an enemy's own block.
//
// Enemy patrol/chase used to clamp against block[enemy.blockNo].start
// / .end - level-design metadata that is set by hand for static
// platforms and only kept in sync for moving platforms because
// controls.h's Moving Wall/Elevator update happens to overwrite it
// every tick. That is a SECOND copy of "where does this platform
// end", separate from height[]/blockData[] (the array the player's
// own collision - playerHeight()/getHeight() - actually reads). The
// two can drift apart: e.g. a moving bridge's block[].start/end is
// initialized once at level-load with the bridge's FULL travel rail
// rather than its actual 128px tile, and is only corrected retro-
// actively on the first physics tick. Any future level edit that
// updates one number and not the other reintroduces the same gap.
// That drift is exactly what let enemies visibly run past the edge
// of their rock: the CLAMP said one edge, but the drawn/collidable
// floor (blockData[]) ended somewhere else.
//
// These two helpers remove the second copy entirely: they walk the
// SAME blockData[] array outward from the enemy's current position
// until it stops matching the enemy's own blockNo, and return that
// as the true world-x edge. An enemy clamped against this can never
// run past where the floor it's standing on actually stops, on any
// platform, moving or static, now or after any future level change -
// because there is only one source of truth for "where is the floor"
// left in the game (this is the exact same array getHeight() reads).

// collision is handled by that separate special-case path instead.
// For those, blockData[] at the enemy's own position never matches
// its blockNo, so the scan above would immediately return a
// zero-width range and freeze the enemy in place. Detect that one

	1) "second moving wall stops moving when the player is standing on
	it" - the old code re-called playerHeight() *inside* this loop to
	figure out whether the player was currently riding the wall being
	processed. That recomputation used height[]/blockData[], which by
	that point could already have been partially rewritten by an
	*earlier* iteration of this same loop (i.e. by mWall[0] before
	mWall[1] is even reached), and it also stomped on the player's
	global playerBlockNo/playerY as a side effect. That made the
	"is the player riding this wall" check unreliable for every wall
	after the first one processed each frame, so the 2nd wall would
	randomly fail to detect the player and effectively drop them -
	which reads as the wall "stopping" under them.
	Fix: figure out which block the player is standing on exactly
	ONCE, at the very start of this section (riderBlock), before any
	wall has moved this frame, and reuse that same snapshot for every
	wall. This makes rider-detection correct and identical no matter
	how many moving walls there are.

	2) "once a moving wall starts moving it shouldn't stop" - the old
	code turned the wall's own switch off (button[...].OnOff = 0) the
	moment it reached either end, "parking" it there until manually
	switched on again. Now the wall never turns its switch off by
	itself: as long as OnOff is on, it keeps moving every frame,
	bouncing back and forth between left and right forever (it just
	flips direction when it hits a limit, and current is clamped so
	it can never overshoot past its rails). The switch only stops it
	if the player presses it again. */
