/* Called once when a new player attack animation frame is reached.
 *
 * This used to only ever check `cEnemy` - the single enemy the game
 * considers "nearest" to the player on the current block, regardless
 * of which way the player is actually facing. That's fine with one
 * enemy, but the moment two enemies flank the player (one in front,
 * one behind - exactly what the enemy-queueing fix above now lets
 * happen cleanly on both sides), the player was stuck only ever being
 * able to damage whichever of the two happened to be nearest overall.
 * Swinging the sword at the enemy in front did nothing if the enemy
 * behind was even one pixel closer, because cEnemy pointed at the
 * back one instead - the front enemy could never be hit first.
 *
 * Now the attack looks at every living enemy on the player's block
 * and picks the nearest one actually in front of the player - on the
 * side k says the player is facing - and within sword range. That
 * lets the player choose which enemy to engage first just by facing
 * it, exactly like a normal action game: face left and swing to hit
 * whoever's on the left, face right to hit whoever's on the right,
 * independent of which one the game happens to consider "nearest".
